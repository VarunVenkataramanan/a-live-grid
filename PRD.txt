Generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the "A-Live-Grid" urban intelligence platform, incorporating all details provided below. The PRD should be structured logically, covering problem, solution, features, technical requirements, and success criteria.


**Project Title: A-Live-Grid: Proactive Urban Intelligence Platform**


**1. Executive Summary**
A-Live-Grid is envisioned as Bengaluru's "nervous system," a proactive and personalized urban intelligence platform designed to address the "Bengaluru Paradox" – a world-class tech hub hindered by infrastructural inefficiency. It aims to provide predictive insights, moving beyond reactive traffic management to help citizens and authorities anticipate urban challenges, such as commute impacts from weather or events, by intelligently synthesizing fragmented public and user-generated data into actionable, personalized intelligence.


**2. Problem Statement**
Bengaluru, despite its status as a global tech hub, suffers from significant infrastructural inefficiencies, particularly in traffic management. Existing civic applications often fail due to technical issues, poor user experience, and a lack of feedback mechanisms, leading to a "Trust Deficit Flywheel" where user disengagement perpetuates data scarcity and unreliability. Generic navigation apps, while offering real-time data, lack the proactive, predictive, and personalized insights necessary for truly efficient urban navigation and planning.


**3. Solution Overview**
A-Live-Grid will function as a comprehensive urban intelligence platform offering predictive insights tailored to individual user patterns. It will refine and synthesize vast amounts of fragmented public and user-generated data to answer forward-looking questions about commute conditions and urban challenges. The platform is built on pillars of reliability, transparency, and demonstrable impact, aiming to rebuild civic trust and empower both citizens and authorities with actionable intelligence.


**4. Goals & Objectives**
The primary goal is to significantly improve urban efficiency and citizen experience in Bengaluru by providing proactive, personalized, and reliable urban intelligence. Key objectives include:
*   To enable citizens to anticipate and plan for urban challenges, reducing commute times and stress.
*   To provide authorities with predictive insights for better infrastructure management and response.
*   To foster civic engagement and rebuild trust through transparent and rewarding participation.
*   To establish a reliable, high-quality dataset for urban intelligence through user contributions and validation.


**5. Target Audience**
The primary target audience includes daily commuters and residents of Bengaluru, as well as urban planning and traffic management authorities.


**6. Key Differentiators & Competitive Analysis**
*   **From Existing Civic Apps (e.g., BTP ASTraM, Public Eye):** A-Live-Grid prioritizes reliability, transparency, and demonstrable impact, directly addressing the "Trust Deficit Flywheel" caused by bugs, poor UI, and lack of feedback in current official applications.
*   **From Generic Navigation Apps (e.g., Google Maps):** While others offer real-time navigation, A-Live-Grid provides proactive, forward-looking predictions tailored to an individual's specific life patterns and routines, offering anticipatory intelligence rather than just current conditions.


**7. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**
*   **Integrated Civic Intelligence:** A gamified "Civic-Cred" system rewards users for reporting issues (e.g., potholes, traffic violations). This mechanism not only builds a rich, real-time dataset but also incorporates a peer-review system to ensure data quality and actively rebuild civic trust.


**8. Detailed Features**


**8.1. Pillar: Proactive Alerts**
This pillar is implicitly supported by the predictive capabilities of the Chatbot and the overall system's ability to synthesize data for forward-looking insights.


**8.2. Pillar: Intelligent Transit**
*   **Chatbot Module:**
    *   **Functionality:** Users can converse with the chatbot to plan routes. The chatbot will perform deep research to inform its route recommendations.
    *   **Data Sources:** Information will be gathered from Twitter, Reddit, news articles, and reports submitted via the A-Live-Grid social media module. Additionally, data from an external weather source will be integrated using a dedicated tool.
    *   **Route Planning Logic:** The chatbot will initially utilize Google’s Route Planning API to determine a base route. This route will then be intelligently modified by the chatbot, taking into account existing traffic hotspots and current/predicted weather conditions derived from the integrated data sources.
    *   **LLM Integration:** Google Gemini Flash model will be used for the underlying conversational AI.
    *   **Agentic Framework:** The existing LangGraph code will be utilized and integrated to support the agentic framework for the chatbot's decision-making and data synthesis.


**8.3. Pillar: Rewarding Engagement**
*   **Social Media Module:**
    *   **Concept:** A Reddit-like platform where users can "post" civic observations and issues.
    *   **Post Data Fields:** Each post will include: username, a short description/title, an image, a long description, a precise street-level location, upvote count, downvote count, and time created.
    *   **Feed Display:** The main feed will display the username, image, and short description/title of each post.
    *   **Full Post View:** Clicking on a feed item will open a full "post" view, displaying the username, short description/title, image, and long description.
    *   **Feed Sorting Logic:** The feed will dynamically sort itself based on a combination of factors: proximity to the user's current location and the post's street-level location, the number of upvotes (descending), and the time created (most recent first).
    *   **Karma System:** A "Karma" token will be awarded based on upvotes. Karma awarded per upvote decreases exponentially as total upvotes increase, meaning the initial upvotes contribute significantly more karma than later ones (e.g., the first upvote might yield 1 karma, while achieving 10 total upvotes might only add 1 more karma, and reaching 100 total upvotes might add yet another 1 karma).
*   **Map Module:**
    *   **Mapping Libraries:** Leaflet and CartoDB will be used for creating and displaying the map interface.
    *   **Data Source:** Street locations for map pins will be derived directly from the "street level location" data submitted in the Social Media module posts.
    *   **Location Validation:** All street locations entered in social media posts will be validated using Google’s Address Validation API to ensure accuracy and consistency.
    *   **Display:** A distinct pin will appear on the map at each validated street location that has been reported via a social media post, visually representing reported issues or observations.


**9. Technical Requirements & Constraints**
*   **Google Services Mandate:** Exclusively use Google services wherever possible for all functionalities.
*   **Specific Google Services:**
    *   Google Address Validation API: Mandatory for validating street locations in social media posts.
    *   Google Route Planning API: Mandatory for initial route determination by the chatbot.
    *   Google Gemini Flash Model: Mandatory for the underlying LLM powering the chatbot.
*   **Agentic Framework:** The existing LangGraph code must be retained and integrated to support the agentic framework for the chatbot and potentially other intelligent components.
*   **Privacy-by-Design:** Implementation of Personalized Federated Learning is crucial to ensure sensitive user location history remains on the device.


**10. Success Metrics**
*   **User Engagement:** Number of active users, daily/monthly posts, average karma earned per user, retention rates.
*   **Efficiency Impact:** Measurable reduction in average commute times for users leveraging A-Live-Grid's predictions.
*   **Prediction Accuracy:** Percentage accuracy of predicted commute times and impact of events (e.g., rain).
*   **Data Quality:** Percentage of validated vs. invalid reported locations, peer-review effectiveness.
*   **Civic Trust:** (If measurable) User sentiment analysis, reported issue resolution rates by authorities (if data is shared).


**11. Assumptions**
*   Availability and reliability of public data sources (Twitter, Reddit, news APIs, weather APIs).
*   User willingness to actively participate in the gamified civic reporting system.
*   Scalability and performance of chosen Google services under high load.
*   Feasibility of integrating Personalized Federated Learning while maintaining performance.


**12. Out of Scope**
*   Direct integration with city infrastructure control systems (e.g., traffic light control).
*   Monetization strategies for the initial launch phase.
*   Support for cities other than Bengaluru in the initial release.
